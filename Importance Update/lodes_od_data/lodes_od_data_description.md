# LODES OD Data File

This folder is in place to store the LODES dataset from the US Census Bureau. After running the data download script, a dataset named `ca_od_main_JT00_{year}.csv` will be stored here. This dataset contains the Origin-Destination (OD) data for California. The dataset is in CSV format.
